# Auto-AUR

Pre-built AUR packages.

## Setup

1. Setup Chotic AUR (recommend)

See https://aur.chaotic.cx/docs

Auto-AUR was created to complement Chaotic-AUR.

Auto-AUR packages may depend on other AUR packages.

In that case, Chaotic-AUR provides the necessary pre-built AUR packages.

2. Run commands (root)

```
pacman-key --recv-key b465fd29d2ea44cc --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
pacman-key --lsign-key b465fd29d2ea44cc
```
